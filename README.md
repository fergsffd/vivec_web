My goal is to create a set of progams that will enter images of objects, taken by a camera, and insert them into a database.
The database entry can include any other information desired.

I got this idea from the need to index/track/label my wife's considerable shoe collection ;)

What I plan on using:
	- Raspberry Pi
	- Camera
	- A button to initiate the capture.
	- Photo setup to take nice images.

	- Python for most of the heavy lifting. 
	- MariaDB(MySQL)
	- I'm thinking a web page for user interace so some JSON stuff. Guess I gotta learn that.
	- Some sort of web page creation program.

Features I would like to do AND are attainable with my current skillset: 
	- GIFfy images so I want to build a 3D printed rotating platform
	- Print feature (print on labels and stick them onto the shoebox)
	- Have a config file/settings module.
	
Features that are a heavy lift for me:
	- Search by characteristics of the captured images - color, style, type. Think Google image search
	- Google Assistant interaction
	- Mobile device access. With the web interface availble, this may not be neccessary.
	
The Ms. gives me the eye roll but this is something fun for me and will, hopefully, not be too frustrating.
Who knows, maybe I will learn something?

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way a professional programmer so expect crap code and not well thought out process/flow. You have been warned!
